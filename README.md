# My-journey-learning-C
A repo of my projects from beginning to end, also serves as a portfoilio in the future.
Just a quick addition to my readme, my approach for any project is to do it alone, no copy pasting codes, and no looking at tutorials and copying from that, I learn fundamentals from the C programming book, (the one by Brian Kermighan) and make this projects from the ground and up. I look forward to making bigger and better projects, as I grow as a developer!
